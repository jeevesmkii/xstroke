# xstroke
The xstroke gesture recogniser written by Carl Worth.

This software, originally written to support Compaq's open source handhelds
project has long since been abandoned and is becoming increasingly hard to 
find. While not useful in its current state, its core gesture recognition
engine is still useful. It is mirrored here for archival purposes.

Released under the terms of the GPLv2. See COPYING for details.

xstroke-0.6 (2004-04-02)
------------------------
Now builds with the autotools rather than imake.

Now includes configurable options USE_SYSTEM_TRAY and USE_PIXMAPS in
xstroke.h, (yes it would be better to make configure options for
these. Volunteers welcome).

There are likely other changes, but we weren't keeping a NEWS file
before. See ChangeLog for more details.

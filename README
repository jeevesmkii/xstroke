What is xstroke?
----------------
xstroke is a gesture recognition program. Performing known gestures in
the xstroke window, (using a stylus, mouse, or other ppointer), will
cause actions to be performed, (most commonly to send character events
to the currently focused window). The known strokes actions and there
corresponding actions are defined in the ${HOME}/.xstrokerc file
described below. The underlying recognizer uses a 3X3 grid,
(originally inspired by libstroke, but now an independent
implementation).

This is the first release of xstroke, (version 0.1), and it should be
considered alpha-quality, (expecially the build environment, or lack
thereof, and documentation). I've found xstroke to be useful and
usable personally, but I have no idea if anyone else will. Also, I did
the X programming in Xlib, (as opposed to Xt or some other toolkit),
as a learning exercise. I'm new to X programming, so there may be some
rough spots.

What does xstroke depend on?
----------------------------
To compile xstroke you will need:
	X
	A C compiler

To generate the diagrams of known strokes you will need:
	perl
	Metapost, (part of the texmf distribution)

Compiling xstroke
-----------------
If you would like to compile xstroke, simply edit the Makefile to
point to correct locations for X and type make. (Yes, this is a
primitive build environment -- something fancy like autoconf will come
in a future release).

To install, copy xstroke to a directory on your path and copy the
default xstrokerc file to ${HOME}/.xstrokerc.

Using xstroke
-------------
The xstrokerc file included with this version of xstroke defines an
alphabet for all lowercase/capital letters, all numbers, and all
punctuation that is on my keyboard, (pc104 US), including Space,
BackSpace, Return, Tab, Escape and the four cursor arrows. It does not
define any accented characters, (although anyone could add
these). Also, xstroke does not yet support modifier keys. (Note: You
can put a modifier key specification in the configuration file, but
currently it will just send a single KeyPress event followed by a
KeyRelease event for that key, just as it does with all other keys. So
this is not very useful for entering modified keys using strokes.) The
next release of xstroke will include support for modifiers.

To use xstroke, simply stroke into its window. For each recognized
stroke, a KeyPress and a KeyRelease event will be sent to the window
that has focus.

Look at the doc/alphabet.ps file to see what the currently defined
strokes are. This document can be regenerated from ${HOME}/.xstrokerc
to include any customized strokes, see doc/generate_diagrams.pl as
well as doc/Makefile.

What alphabet is this?
----------------------
The default alphabet in xstrokerc is an original alphabet that I
created. I made many strokes similar to the strokes in the program
xscribble. The big difference in my alphabet is that I do not use any
shift modes, (capitals, num-shift, punc-shift, etc). Instead, I have
all letters, numbers, and punctuation defined in a single alphabet. To
do this, I've implemented capital letters as strokes just like the
corresponding lowercase stroke, but with the last line segment
repeated in the opposit direction. For example, the capital 'L' stroke
goes down, to the right, then back to the left, (1478987). Most
numbers, (except 6, 8, and 9), are drawn in reverse to distinguish
them from letters. My punctuation alphabet is largely custom. The
alphabet also includes many strokes shaped like lowercase letters, (b,
d, e, etc.) that do not exist in xscribble.

See doc/alphabet.ps for a more exact depiction of the alphabet.

Also, see doc/xstroke_vs_xscribble if you are interested in how this
alphabet differs from xscribble's.

Will you add support for modes?
-------------------------------
I plan to make a future release of xstroke that will support
modes. Then, anyone that cares to could implement their favorite modal
alphabet.

Can I make my own strokes?
--------------------------
The xstroke configuration file, (${HOME}/.xstrokerc), defines strokes
and actions to be performed when the stroke is entered. Currently, the
only supported action is to send a KeyPress and KeyRelease event to
the currently focused window. Future releases of xstroke will add
support for addition actions including sending strings of characters,
(macro expansion), as well as executing commands. See the
doc/configuration file for an explanation of the syntax of
${HOME}/.xstrokerc or just dive in and figure it out!

Well, that's about it. Feel free to send me comments, suggestions, or
bug fixes.
